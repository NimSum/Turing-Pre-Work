  <h3>About Me:</h3>
  <div>
    <h4>Why code?</h4>
    <p class="paragraph1">I was born and raised in the Philippines before moving to the USA at the age of 13. As I was growing up, the environment I lived in had little to no exposure to the internet, until we migrated to USA. My interests evolved as I was growing up. I  was addicted to online gaming. I was not that interested in how it worked and this is how it went for a long time until graduating from high-school. I joined the military right after of high-school because I could not afford higher education and I did know what career I was most interested in.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p class="paragraph2">Being in the military has benefited me greatly, it has given me the opportunity to discover more about myself and my interests. Over time, my interest towards the technology industry and its future began to develop. I became a huge fan of <span class=" italicize">rockets, electric cars, AI, automation, renewable energy, etc.</span> One of my goals is to work in those industries because I believe that these industries have a bright future and I want to be a part of that future.</p>
